# homebrew-coastguard-test

Test Homebrew tap for the Coastguard CLI. This tap is used to validate the install/update flow before creating the production tap.

## Usage

```
brew tap jsx-tool/coastguard-test
brew install jsx-tool/coastguard-test/coastguard
```

## Note

This is a test tap. The formula will be auto-updated by goreleaser on each CLI release. Delete or rename once the flow is validated.
